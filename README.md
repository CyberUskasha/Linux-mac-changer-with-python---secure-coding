# Linux-mac-changer-with-python---secure-coding

Hey There !

Following is a mac address changing script I wrote in Python for Linux.

The syntax for giving argumets is following (remove quote marks):
->python macChanger.py  --interface 'name' --mac '00:21:22:33:44:33'


This is implementation of secure programming that will not allow user/misuser to breakout and execute malicious shell commands.

Let me know if this can be improved in any way.

Thanks. Have a Good Day
